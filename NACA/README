1) NACA2gmsh_inflation.m is an octave file which generated two NACA profiles enveloping each other. This is useful to generate hybrid meshes. The generated co-ordinates are in gmsh format. So they can be used in a gmsh file and modified to create a hybrid mesh. Follow the below commands to run.

chmod +x NACA2gmsh_inflation.m 
./NACA2gmsh_inflation.m

For more info about running the script refer here ----> https://www.hpc.ntnu.no/display/hpc/OpenFOAM+-+Airfoil+Calculations in the "Geometry and Mesh" section. 

2) NACA_coordinates_inflation_noskew.geo is an example of a hybrid mesh generated this way.

3) I will automate this process in the future so that executing a shell script will generate a high quality hybrid mesh.

The NACA2gmsh_inflation.m is derived from here -----> https://www.hpc.ntnu.no/download/attachments/4587566/NACA2STL.m?version=2&modificationDate=1344859930000&api=v2 . The creator -----> HÃ¥kon Strandenes, hakostra@stud.ntnu.no
