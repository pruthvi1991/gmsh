This is an attempt to mesh a flatplate using a hybrid(structured+unstructured mesh). The geometry has an outer bounding box and inner region of interest where a strctured mesh is generated. The inner region is divided into 8 regions to generate an orthogonal mesh.

In the file directory type:
gmsh flatplate_bl.geo

Then press the keyboard key 2 to view the mesh. The plate is very thin so zoom in a lot to view the plate.
